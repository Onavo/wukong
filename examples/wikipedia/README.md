## Encodings
SQL dumps are theoretically encoded in UTF-8, but the Wikipedia dumps contain malformed characters. You might see a 'Invalid UTF-8 byte sequence' error when running a Wukong job as a result.

To fix this, use `guard_encoding` in MungingUtils to filter out invalid characters before attempting to process them. `guard_encoding` replaces all invalid characters with 'ï¿½'.

If you're piping things around on the command line and need to filter stuff there, pipe them through char_filter.rb.

If, for some reason, you need an invalid UTF-8 character, pretty much any single-byte character above \x79 will do. e.g:

    [1] pry(main)> char = "\x80"
    => "\x80"
    [2] pry(main)> char.encoding.name
    => "UTF-8"
    [3] pry(main)> char.valid_encoding?
    => false
