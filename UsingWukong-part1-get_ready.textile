h1. Using Wukong and Wuclan, Part 1 - Scraping

This part needs writing.

Later, it will tell you how to get a large corpus of data to use in part 2.

In the meantime check out http://infochimps-labs.github.com/monkeyshines/ and http://infochimps-labs.github.com/wuclan/ -- in particular the "Twitter Search Scraper":http://github.com/infochimps-labs/wuclan/tree/master/examples/twitter/scrape_twitter_search/ example.  We use this in production to gather and analyze tens of gigabytes of twitter conversations.
